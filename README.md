## How do Code agents work?

Our [`CodeAgent`](https://huggingface.co/docs/smolagents/reference/agents#smolagents.CodeAgent) works mostly like classical ReAct agents - the exception being that the LLM engine writes its actions as Python code snippets.

    Task[User Task]
    Memory[agent.memory]
    Generate[Generate from agent.model]
    Execute[Execute Code action - Tool calls are written as functions]
    Answer[Return the argument given to 'final_answer']

    Task -->|Add task to agent.memory| Memory

    subgraph ReAct[ReAct loop]
        Memory -->|Memory as chat messages| Generate
        Generate -->|Parse output to extract code action| Execute
        Execute -->|No call to 'final_answer' tool => Store execution logs in memory and keep running| Memory
    end
    
    Execute -->|Call to 'final_answer' tool| Answer
